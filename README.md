**Project:**
Sustainable Living Platform
Welcome to our Sustainable Living Platform project! This platform aims to promote sustainable practices and environmental awareness. Users can monitor their carbon footprint, track waste management, and contribute to environmental initiatives. Below, you'll find information about the project structure, functionalities, and how to get started.

**Project Overview :**
The Sustainable Living Platform is a web application built using Django, a high-level Python web framework. It incorporates various features to encourage sustainable living practices and carbon emissions reduction.

The application includes:

**User Authentication and Profile Management:**
Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.
User profiles include information about their carbon credits and other sustainability-related activities.

**Carbon Footprint Tracking:**
Users can track their carbon footprint by inputting data related to their daily activities.
Emission factors for different waste types are used to calculate carbon emissions.

**Waste Management:**
Users can input data about their waste production, categorized by waste type (plastic, paper, metal, etc.).
The system calculates the carbon emissions based on the waste types and quantities provided.

**Carbon Credits and Trading:**
Users earn carbon credits based on their sustainable practices and waste reduction efforts.
Credits earned can be used for environmental initiatives or traded within the platform.

**Machine Learning Integration:**
Machine learning models predict waste types based on images uploaded by users.
Predictions assist in waste categorization and emission calculations.

**Project Structure**
The project structure is organized as follows:

**Getting Started**

Clone the Repository:


```
git clone <repository-url>
cd sustainable-living-platform
Create a Virtual Environment:
```

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
